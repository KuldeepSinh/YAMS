<b>Yet Another MQTT Server (in Erlang): </b>

Implement MQTT using Erlang/OTP. Other inspiration behind developing YAMS is my wish to learn and meet the technical challenges of handling hundreds of thousand concurrent connections, if not millions.

<b>Whats in the name: </b>

The name, YAMS, is inspired by one of the populer web-servers YAWS (http://hyber.org/).
