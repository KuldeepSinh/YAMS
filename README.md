Î»AMS
====

Yet Another MQTT Server (in Erlang): At present YAMS is in its very early stage. But the idea is to learn Erlang/OTP while doing it. First make it work follow it by Writing beautiful Erlnag code. Other goal is, somewhat to meet technical challenges of making YAMS handle millions of concurrent TCP connections. Of course for that to make possible, awsome Erlang community is there to mentor and inspire!!!
